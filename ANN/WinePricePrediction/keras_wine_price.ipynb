      "A strongly flavored Cabernet, powerful in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, that impresses for sheer volume, although it is drinkable now with a brief decant. It's a bit rude now, but could calm down and develop some bottle sophistication in a few years.\n",
      "Predicted:  28.954346 Actual:  25.0 \n",

      "This is a 50-50 blend of estate-grown Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. Dark, plush, well-ripened fruit is the focus of a wine still a bit stiff and steely. It's classic in the way a Bordeaux is classic, firm and confidently blended.\n",

      "This is the best Cab from Two Vines to date. It's got real concentration and fruit flavor, enhanced with the addition of 11% Cab Franc and 7% Syrah in the blend. Berries, cherries, cassis, plums, coffee and smoke filter through the palate, with just a little bite to the tannins. Very impressive.\n",

      "A nice Zinfandel that's dry and fruity, with briary, brambly blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors. It's a clean, vibrant Zin, but a very tough, tannic one. Needs ultrarich fare to crack through the astringency.\n",
      "Predicted:  35.764526 Actual:  38.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A very fine effort, with classic cassis and black cherry in the fruit core, but also offering interesting details of bark, earth and herb. The wine lingers, perhaps due to excellent natural acidity, and without overpowering the palate it keeps tantalizing it with nuances of moist earth and wet rock.\n",
      "Predicted:  23.60781 Actual:  22.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A dusty-textured wine, its fruit like grains scattered over the surface of a fresh crisp structure. The freshness is palpable and so is the depth of flavor. A food-friendly wine.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sourced entirely from Les Collines, this perfectly expresses the house style—scents of strawberry jam, hints of pepper, and flavors that seem to focus on rocky minerality. An austere yet thrilling wine, almost like a Chinon, though this is Syrah, and not Cabernet Franc.\n",

      "Here's a wine that opens beautifully to all your senses. It boasts a dense, vibrant ruby color and delivers bright aromas of cherry, blackberry and bitter cranberry. In the mouth, however, this wine is softer and plusher than you'd expect. Sure, that trademark Barbera acidity is present, but its natural sharpness has been dulled.\n",
      "Predicted:  96.18182 Actual:  90.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Aged in neutral oak and 100% varietal, this is a fine value. There is great fruit flavor—raspberry and Bing cherry—supported with natural acidity and just a hint of chocolate. This could be a Dry Creek Zinfandel, in terms of its bright berry fruit and lively acidity.\n",
      "Predicted:  18.943602 Actual:  16.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A very pretty Merlot, and a good price for the elegant quality. It's dry and tannic, showing the Clos du Val style of controlled, somewhat aloof ripeness. There's a rich, attractive core of black cherry fruit. Will develop for a few years, but it's really best now, with a brief decant.\n",
      "Predicted:  28.84375 Actual:  26.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate, coffee and espresso come to life thanks to the solid base of natural fruit that keeps the wine lively and fresh. Fruit and oak-related aromas work well together and give the wine brightness, softness and a velvety texture.\n",
      "Predicted:  15.938208 Actual:  19.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Another fine value from Kirkland, the Costco house brand. Vineyard sources are first rate, mostly Wahluke Slope, and the wine has exceptional grip, depth and structure for Merlot at this price point. Cassis, dark plum, black cherry, licorice, espresso and smoke are woven together nicely. Tannins are lush, substantial and quite ripe; they wrap up the wine with a blanket of smoke and tar. A great steak wine.\n",
      "Predicted:  5.2966833 Actual:  10.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.\n",
      "Predicted:  48.5891 Actual:  46.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Representing a good value in top-flight Cabernet, Jim Barry's 2008 The Cover Drive (a cricketing term) features subtle hints of cinnamon, coffee and vanilla layered over blueberry and plum fruit. It's on the full-bodied side, with plush, velvety tannins balanced by crisp acids. Drink now–2018.\n",
      "Predicted:  21.237242 Actual:  18.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "A top value, this full-bodied yet supple Shiraz packs in the flavor, starting with dark, brooding fruit on the nose, developing intensely flavored mixed berries on the palate and finishing warm and long. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:  24.201101 Actual:  19.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Smooth and sophisticated with rich blackberry and plum aromas backed by oak-driven tones of spice and leather, this is a very rich expression of Barbera (that sees eight months in oak barrels). The overall effect is excellent and the mouthfeel culminates with bright tones of prune and crushed black pepper.\n",
      "Predicted:  22.408182 Actual:  20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Crisp red apples and tight fruit skins give this wine a taut, lively character. Just a touch of caramel to broaden the acidity.\n",
      "Predicted:  20.112371 Actual:  18.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Gold in color, with an ebullient nose of spiced melon and sweet flavors of candied pineapple tinged with white pepper and grapefruit. At 12.5% alcohol and 117 g/L residual sugar, it's rich and sweet without being over the top. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:  18.695555 Actual:  19.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Winemaker Joe Forest has brightened the fruit and livened up the mouthfeel by blending in 20% Grenache. Fresh raspberry flavors are wrapped into the earthier, herbal, lightly chocolaty character of the Syrah. Once-filled French barrels were used.\n",
      "Predicted:  27.736473 Actual:  25.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "It's unfortunate that only 56 cases of this wine were imported, so be sure to snag it when you see it. Intense and powerful on the nose, with attractive forest, licorice, tea leaves and menthol adding complexity to the small red berries and plum skins. The velvety texture and firm structure lead nicely into the mocha-flavored finish, with flecks of white pepper gleaming through on the very end.\n",
      "Predicted:  48.55365 Actual:  37.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This winery, part of the San Pedro group, is on the right path as its wines have improved in recent vintages. This particular wine marks a high-water point; the nose mixes dry wood notes, leather, herbal berry and even some fine aged cheese. The palate is tight and forceful, with cassis, cherry and cola flavors. Powerful but poised. Drink now through 2012.\n",
      "Predicted:  28.025797 Actual:  23.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Back on form after the disappointing 2008, Nobilo's Icon deftly combines hints of honey and stone fruit with a leafy overlay of herbal flavors. It's medium bodied, with a finish that's tinged with tobacco leaf. Drink now and over the next 6–9 months.\n",
      "Predicted:  16.304693 Actual:  20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Sidewood's consulting winemaker, Nathasha Mooney (who made the still-stunning 1998 E&E; Black Pepper Shiraz while at Barossa Valley Estate), is putting together some excellent wines that also represent good value, including this grapefruit-scented Sauvignon Blanc. This medium-bodied offering is long and intense, blending citrus with minerally spice reminiscent of white pepper.\n",
      "Predicted:  17.859745 Actual:  16.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This Bordeaux blend shows an interesting range of fruit flavors and textures from the blend, which includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. The flavors tend toward red fruits, as in cherries and red currants, while the tannins are quite strong. Shows an immaturity now that strongly suggests 5–6 years in the cellar.\n",
      "Predicted:  67.33353 Actual:  65.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a rich and chocolaty expression of Barbera d'Alba with thick concentration and immediate aromas of black currant and cherry. The wine is dense and extracted with smooth, drying tannins and a piquant blast of acidity on the close.\n",
